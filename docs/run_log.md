# Run log

Chronological record of runs on real data. One entry per job. Raw outputs are kept in the Kaggle kernel named in each entry and, when fetched, under `runs/kaggle/<slug>/` (not tracked).

## 2026-11-10 — feature extraction

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Job | `scripts/kaggle/jobs/features.yaml` |
| Kernel | `arunavganguly/abstraction-features`, version 2 |
| Commit | `7f190ac` (`base`) |
| Hardware | Tesla T4, 15360 MiB |
| Software | torch 2.11.0+cu130, transformers 5.20.2 |
| Result | completed |

Art collection (`build_art_set.py`, source `steubk/wikiart`, 128 x 128 px):

| Style | Images |
|---|---|
| Abstract_Expressionism | 2782 |
| Color_Field_Painting | 1615 |
| Minimalism | 1337 |
| Action_painting | 98 |
| Total | 5832 |

Unreadable files: 0. Duration: 606 s. No de-duplication was performed.

MERT embeddings (`extract_mert.py`, source `imsparsh/fma-free-music-archive-small-medium`, directory `fma_small`):

- mp3 files found: 8000.
- Tracks embedded: 7994; array per track (3 windows, 13 layers, 768), float16; 8 shards, 479 MB.
- Tracks skipped: 6. `098565`, `098567`, `098569` shorter than 30 s; `099134`, `108925`, `133297` not decodable. These are the six files listed as defective in the FMA documentation for `fma_small`.
- Hidden states were read with forward hooks (`route = hooks`); the model output carried `hidden_states = None` under transformers 5.20.2.
- Duration: 3052 s.

Earlier attempts:

- Version 1 (commit `afec30a`): art collection built; extraction failed with `TypeError` on `hidden_states = None`. Fixed in `7f190ac`.
- `arunavganguly/abstraction-mert-check-cpu` (commit `7f190ac`, CPU): 16 tracks embedded, output shape (16, 3, 13, 768), all values finite.
